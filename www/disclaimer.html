    This calculator is in no way authoritative. The tool effectively uses freely accesible formulas for  calculations. To be clear, there is no support facility in effect, yet you can of course contact the develeper if you deem it is an adeqauate course of action. No barriers imposed. helvete!

Also this tool uses no cookies, does not store the calculated data and in no way tracks the user involved. Well, you can see no JS GA shit is involved and for the backend you gotta trust us until we port the source to github or some other transparent repository host. The engine is quite transparent though, you can inspect it <a href="https://github.com/helvete/salary_calc_tools">here</a>.
