    This calculator is in no way authoritative. The tool uses freely accesible formulas to base calculations upon. It is of course possible to use <a href="https://github.com/helvete/czech_salary_calc_gui/issues">issues</a> to submit bug reports and ideas for new features.
<br />
<br />
Also this tool uses no cookies, does not store the calculated data anywhere in any form and in no way tracks the user involved. Well, you can see no JS BS is involved and as for the backend feel free to inspect the source code <a href="https://github.com/helvete/czech_salary_calc_gui">@github</a>. Since this web application serves just as a frontend for the calculator, you may want to take a peek at the backend logic - the actual engine, which is located <a href="https://github.com/helvete/salary_calc_tools">here</a>.
